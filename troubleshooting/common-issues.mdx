### I subscribed to Pro but I'm stuck on the free tier

First, give it a few minutes to update. If that doesn't work, try logging out of Codeium on the website, restarting your IDE, and logging back into Codeium. Additionally, please make sure you have the latest version of Codeium installed.

### How do I cancel my Pro/Teams subscription?

You can cancel your paid plan by going to your Profile (top right of the [Codeium website](https://codeium.com/profile)) -> Billing -> Cancel Plan

### My Codeium Chat screen goes blank

Please reach out to us if this happens! A screen recording would be much appreciated. This can often be solved by clearing your chat history.
