Codeium is a toolkit designed to empower developers with best in class AI code completion, chat, search, and more. It’s used by hundreds of thousands of developers around the world and writes millions of lines of code every month.

Codeium is **powered by LLMs trained by the Codeium team specifically for writing code.** Our models have been trained on 70+ languages and have a deep understanding of your codebase to provide faster and better suggestions than any other AI code tool.

In this tutorial, we will interactively walk you through what Codeium can do as well as tips and tricks on how to use it to best suit your programming needs.

_This tutorial currently only walks through a TypeScript example (don’t worry if you haven’t written TypeScript, Codeium writes most of the code) using the VS Code extension. Some features may not be available in other extensions._

_Additionally, if you are on our Self-Hosted Enterprise Plan, functionality may differ, please refer to the Codeium University on your enterprise portal._
