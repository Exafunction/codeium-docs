Custom Instructions influence the context engine by injecting into each prompt.

For example, if you want Codeium Chat to only respond in Typescript, you can give it the following instruction:

<img width = "500px" src="/assets/custominstructions.png"/>

We will be updating the docs with some best practice Custom Instructions for a variety of different use cases soon!
