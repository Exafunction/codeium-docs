While Codeium's retrieval engine does an excellent job of figuring out the most relevant context, sometimes developers themselves know best. 

<Tip>Click on the `CONTEXT` tab in the Codeium side-panel</Tip>

Choose to pin Directories, Files, Repositories, or Code Context Items (like functions, classes, etc.) as persistent context as shown below. These items are pulled in for every suggestion.

Context Pinning is great for situations where you know you will be needing to reference information from other files for the duration of your current task. 

# Best Practices

- Try to pin only what you need. Pinning too much can slow down or negatively impact model performance.

- Examples of when to use context pinning:

    - Internal Frameworks/Libraries: Pinning directories with code examples for using frameworks/libraries.

    - Module Definitions: Pinning class/struct definition files inside your repo but in another module.

    - Specific Tasks: Pinning a file or folder defining a particular interface (e.g., .proto files, abstract class files, config templates).

    - Current Focus Area: Pinning the "lowest common denominator" directory containing the majority of files needed for your current coding session.

    - Testing: Pinning a particular file with the class you are writing unit tests for.
