Working through a finnicky section of state-management code?
Need a hand writing a few tricky utility functions?
Can't quite remember the right sequence of API calls?

**Codeium Command** might the tool for the job.
Command lets you generate and edit code directly in the editor
following explicit natural-language instructions,
at a greater scope than autocomplete.

Press `Ctrl+I` or `⌘+I` to open the Command interface.
This will position Command to generate code at your current cursor position.
You can also trigger Command on a selection of highlighted code,
in which case Command will be positioned to edit the lines spanning the selection.
Type an instruction, and hit `Ctrl+⏎` or `⌘+⏎` to submit it.
