Oftentimes when we’re writing a simple code block, it’s much easier and faster to describe what we want through natural language. For all the cases where you want to instruct the model to write some code in a file, use Codeium Command. Writing a new component where one button is double the width of the other or creating an entire function from scratch–Codeium Command can be your go-to tool.

To invoke Command, hit Ctrl (or Cmd on Mac) + I. From there, you can enter a prompt in natural language and Codeium will provide a multiline suggestion that you can accept or reject.

You can also use Command to edit existing functions as shown below. Simply highlight the code you wish to edit and press Ctrl (or Cmd on Mac) + I:

# Best Practices

- Command is great for command based, in-line changes

    - This model is training to be especially good at instruction following

    - This model runs on a larger model than autocomplete

    - Make sure to highlight the entire block of code you want Command to apply the diff on
