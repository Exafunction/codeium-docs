Oftentimes when we’re writing a simple code block, it’s much easier and faster to describe what we want through natural language. For all the cases where you want to instruct the model to write some code in a file, use Codeium Command. Writing a new component where one button is double the width of the other or creating an entire function from scratch–Codeium Command can be your go-to tool.

As a disclaimer, Codeium Command is not as fast as Codeium Autocomplete, and is also more prone to inserting unnecessary extra lines of code or incorrect indentation. We’re working on making this better, but for now, treat it as a tool to make large code suggestions that may need to edit before committing.

Let’s return to the PetHotel class with an example:

### Writing a New function

Let’s try adding a new function to the PetHotel class to book out all the rooms. Press `⌘` + `⇧` + `I`, type in the command, submit it, give your eyes a little break or grab a sip of water and check out the code suggested by Codeium. You can quickly accept it by clicking `⌥` + `A`.

Here is the command we used:

```Write a function to book out the entire hotel for one day and return the total number of rooms that were reserved.```

Feel free to try out adding any other function you want as well, just try to be as clear and precise in your instructions as possible.
