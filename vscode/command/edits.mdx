Codeium Command can also be used to edit existing blocks of code. All you have to do is highlight what you would like to modify and give it instructions on what you want to change.

This can be exceptionally useful when you need to make many small changes throughout a larger chunk of code, but there are also various other use cases people have found, so try it out and let us know what works for you!

Let’s give it a shot by editing our PetHotel code:

### Edit a New Function

Let’s use Codeium Command to edit our registerPet function to enable people to specify their minimum size requirement. Select the function, press `⌘` + `⇧` + `I`, and tell Codeium to add the parameter and watch as it updates all the necessary parts of the code.

Here is the command we used:

```Add a minimum size parameter```

Beware, Codeium might have some errors such as the indenting, so we would definitely recommend looking over the code before accepting the change. Treat it like a small change made by a developer more junior than yourself which you must review before committing.
