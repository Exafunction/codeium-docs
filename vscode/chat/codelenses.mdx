NOTE: This feature is only supported in: VS Code, JetBrains, Eclipse, Visual Studio.

NOTE: This feature may not be supported in Self-Hosted Enterprise Plan.

To make some of the most common patterns for chat easier to use, Codeium offers code lenses on top of functions and classes in supported languages. The two supported functionalities are:

1. **Documentation**: Documentation: Generates a docstring for the function based on documentation practices for the used language.

2. **Explanation**: Explanation: Summarizes and explains the code of the selected code snippet.

Note that this function can be disabled if you toggle the Codeium: Enable Code Lens setting in VS Code.

Let’s quickly try it out:

<Steps>
      <Step title = "Class Explanation">
        The bookOutHotel class we wrote earlier did not contain a docstring, so let’s make sure the code remains readable by auto generating a docstring. Click the Generate JSDoc button and then apply and accept the diff to add the docstring to the code.
