Chatting with AI has gained a lot of popularity over the past few years and Codeium brings that experience right into your IDE by providing the best models and tools to answer code-related questions.

1. **Context Awareness**: Just like autocomplete, Codeium Chat grabs snippets from relevant parts of your codebase to provide more accurate, grounded answers.

2. **IDE Integration**: Codeium Chat can also use information from the files you’re currently editing and the changes you’ve made to guide you in the right direction.

3. **Code-first Tooling**: Finally, Codeium Chat provides various shortcuts to easily access its AI for various common use cases like unit tests or library usage questions.

Don’t just take our word for it, open Codeium Chat from the Codeium side panel or using the shortcut above, and ask it some questions! Once you’ve played around with it, proceed to the next tutorials to learn how to level up your chat experience.
