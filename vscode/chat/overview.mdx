This feature is only supported in: VS Code, JetBrains, Eclipse, Visual Studio.

Codeium Chat enables you to chat with your codebase in natural language from inside the IDE itself. It leverages code snippets from the relevant parts of your codebase to provide the most accurate, and grounded answers. It's like ChatGPT if it had full context about your codebase. 

You can open Codeium Chat from the side panel or use the shortcut `Shift` + `Cmd` + `A`.

For a developer to properly Chat with language models, the models need to be able to retrieve information that is relative to your codebase. This is what we refer to as [Context Awareness](/vscode/contextawareness/overview.mdx), and it's the secret sauce that makes Codeium great.

Just like with Autocomplete, Codeium Chat grabs snippets from relevant parts of your codebase and weaves them into our language models to provide more accurate, grounded answers.


### @ Mentions 

Because of our advanced parsing system, you can avoid copy-pasting your reference code and easily add more custom context in Chat just by using @ Mentions. Avoid copy-pasting code and help guide the AI to what you know to be relevant by referencing your functions, classes, files, directories, and repositories.

For more information, please see our [@ Mentions](/vscode/chat/atmentions.mdx) page.

### Inline Citations

In an effort to provide insight into Chat's responses, our reasoning engine will pull in the most relevant context it used from your codebase.

### Code Lenses

Code lenses will appear right above functions and class definitions and offer shortcuts to common tasks that developers want to accomplish such as Generate Docstrings, Explain Code, and Refactor code. Clicking on these shortcuts will automatically invoke Codeium Chat with the relevant prompt and context, giving developers a 1-click solution for common tasks.

Please note that this function can be disabled if you toggle the Codeium: Enable Code Lens setting in VS Code.

### Context Pinning: 

By default, user messages will contain the text you type, but you can also pin any scope of code (repository, directory, file, function, etc). This tells Codeium to prioritize this specific code when it gives suggestions in both Autocomplete and Chat.

For more information, please see our [Context Pinning](/vscode/contextawareness/contextpinning.mdx) page.
