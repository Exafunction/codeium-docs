This feature is only supported in: VS Code, JetBrains, Eclipse, Visual Studio.

Codeium Chat enables you to chat with your codebase in natural language from inside the IDE itself. It leverages code snippets from the relevant parts of your codebase to provide the most accurate, and grounded answers. It's like ChatGPT if it had full context about your codebase. 

You can open Codeium Chat from the side panel or use the shortcut `Shift` + `Cmd`/`Ctrl` + `A`.

For a developer to properly Chat with language models, the models need to be able to retrieve information that is relative to your codebase. This is what we refer to as [Context Awareness](/vscode/contextawareness/overview.mdx), and it's the secret sauce that makes Codeium great.

Just like with Autocomplete, Codeium Chat grabs snippets from relevant parts of your codebase and weaves them into our language models to provide more accurate, grounded answers.


### @ Mentions 

Because of our advanced parsing system, you can easily add more custom context in Chat just by using @ Mentions. Avoid copy-pasting code and help guide the AI to what you know to be relevant by referencing your functions, classes, files, directories, and repositories.

For more information, please see our [@ Mentions](/vscode/chat/atmentions) page.

To persist certain context, please see our [Context Pinning](/vscode/contextawareness/contextpinning) page.

### Slash Commands

Text-based triggers for common workflows, building on top of Code Lenses and right click dropdown on highlight. We are starting with simply typing `/explain` in the Chat input, but [let us know](https://codeium.canny.io/feature-requests/) what other common workflows you want wrapped in a slash command.

### Copy and Insert

Easily `Copy` to clipboard and/or `Insert` snippets of suggested code directly from the Chat.

### Inline Citations

In an effort to provide insight into Chat's responses, our reasoning engine will pull in the most relevant context it used from your codebase.

### Code Lenses

Code lenses will appear right above functions and class definitions and offer shortcuts to common tasks that developers want to accomplish such as `Generate` Docstrings, `Explain` Code, and `Refactor` code. Clicking on these shortcuts will automatically invoke Codeium Chat with the relevant prompt and context, giving developers a 1-click solution for common tasks. 

Read more docs on [Code Lenses](/vscode/chat/codelenses.mdx).

<Note>This function can be disabled if you toggle the Codeium: Enable Code Lens setting in VS Code.</Note>

### Regenerate with Context

Our system makes a judgment call whether a question requires context from the codebase or is just a generic question around software development concepts. However, if you want to force the use of codebase context, you can quickly rerun with context with a single button.

### Chat Insights

Lots of work is clearly going on under the hood for every Chat message, and now you can click the stats icon to see these statistics for yourself. Was context used? How long did the various stages take? How many context items were considered?

### Chat History 

Continue past conversations and quickly recall responses in the top right of the Codeium side panel with the `Chat` tab open. Next to the chat history, you can also click on the `â‹®` button to export your conversation.

### Chat Settings

Click on the `Settings` tab in the Codeium panel in order to update Theme Preference and Font settings. 

You can also pop the Chat window out into the editor panel by clicking the file button in the top right of the Codeium panel.
