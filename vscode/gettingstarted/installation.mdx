      <Step title = "Authorize">

        After installation is complete, you should be prompted by Visual Studio Code with a pop-up on the bottom right to authorize Codeium. If not, you should see an option to sign in to your Codeium account in the bottom left Accounts tab of your Visual Studio Code window.
        
        Click the Sign in with Auth to use Codeium option. Either method (popup or Accounts tab) should redirect you to the Codeium website.
        
        <Tip>Tip: If you get an error message saying that the browser cannot open a link from Visual Studio Code, you may need to update your browser and restart the authorization flow.</Tip>

      <Step title = "Create Account">

        If you do not have a Codeium account yet, you will be redirected to create an account.
        
        _Why do we require an account? In order to remove abuse of the product and make sure that we know you are an early user, we ask to authorize Codeium extensions with an account before use. We do not use, share, or sell any identifying information for any purpose._

      </Step>
      <Step title = "Sign In">

        If you are not signed in, please sign in with your account details. Once you sign in, you will be redirected back to Visual Studio Code via pop-up.
        
        _If you are using a browser-based IDE, instead of being redirected back with pop-up, you will be routed to instructions on how to complete authentication by providing an access token._

      </Step>
      <Step title = "Wait for language server">

        Once you are all signed in, Codeium will start downloading the language server. This is the program that actually communicates with our APIs to let you use Codeium. Depending on your internet connection, this download may take a few minutes.
        
        You should see a notification on the bottom right to indicate the progress of the download.
