When people try autocomplete for the first time, we get mixed reviews on how they feel. Some people immediately love it while others are displeased by incorrect suggestions, security concerns, or a variety of other very justified reasons. We know that Codeium Autocomplete is nowhere near a perfect tool and it’s definitely not meant to replace any software jobs, but one thing is clear: even in its current state, Codeium Autocomplete is a productivity boost for all engineers that use it.

It takes some time to get used to and there is a learning curve, but everyone we’ve seen can’t get enough of it after using it for just a few weeks. That being said there are some common tips and misconceptions that we wanted to clarify:

## 1. Codeium Autocomplete is not for large code changes or answering questions:

To provide some clarity: Codeium Autocomplete optimizes for speed and efficiency, not large-scale, multi-level thinking. In its current stage, you cannot expect the same model which provides you suggestions in less than a quarter of a second to do these different, harder tasks too well. We offer you Codeium Command and Codeium Chat for these other functionalities, so make good use of them when it’s appropriate.

## 2. Sometimes we complete too much, sometimes we complete too little.

We attempt to make a completion on every keystroke, however there are also many reasons why you may not get a suggestion (low confidence in suggestion, latency, etc). Codeium should be treated like a Passive AI where you can accept the completions when they are helpful, ignore them when they are bad, and not waste time waiting for them when they might not show up. This may seem distracting at first, but give it some time and we guarantee it will become more and more natural.

## 3. Context matters.

Just like if you’re collaborating with another engineer, good code helps a lot. Use clear codes and documentations, comments, and naming to help the AI help you.
