Especially when using unfamiliar libraries or languages, Codeium autocomplete can be a huge help in generating ideas to unblock your coding. By looking through surrounding content or relevant context from your codebase, and understanding general software patterns, our models provide possible completions to your code which often assist in moving forward.

The way we look at it, Codeium might not always know what you’re doing or the right way to proceed, but it’s the fastest tool out there to at least try an idea out. If it’s correct, then great, you can accept the suggestion and move on. But even if not, just seeing the suggestion can spark an idea in your mind. Maybe the for loop it writes doesn’t call the right functions, but it might iterate over the right variable or even just have the right syntax which can guide you to write the code you actually intended on writing.

Let’s try this out by seeing what we can do with long PetHotel class.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="1. Checking ratings">
    Let’s start off with a simple use case: we want to start off by checking the rating of the PetHotel is above 4 stars, but its not exactly clear how to do so. Is it petHotel.rating > 4, or petHotel.getRating() > 4, or even something like petHotel.info.rating > 4? Instead of looking through the code to find out, just let Codeium read through it and find out for you.

    _Remember that Codeium only suggests code when you type. To use Codeium within the parentheses, start typing petHotel and escape if any Intellisense shows up._

  <Accordion title="2. Registration">
    Now let’s register our pet, Fluffy, to the hotel for a week. Once again Codeium automatically reads through the implementation to figure out the parameters required to do so. Unfortunately, there is no code for it to reference to know how many days you want to register for, so it takes a random guess for that parameter. While it’s not perfect, it provides a good starting point that you can edit to reach the code you want.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="3. Finding Area">
    In addition to helping you look through the code, Codeium is also getting smarter by the day and can perform some basic reasoning to help you out. While there is no function that returns the area of the room, Codeium can figure out that there is a length and width which can be used to calculate it.
