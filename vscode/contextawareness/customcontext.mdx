Custom Context allows you to add specific instructions or preferences in natural language to every request sent to Codeium's Chat modality. This helps guide the AI to generate results within set parameters, such as programming languages, frameworks, and spoken languages (e.g., "Use Tailwind CSS in React TypeScript, respond in Spanish, when explaining code start with overall purpose and then break it down line by line").

You can set the custom context on the Context tab of the Chat Panel as shown below.
