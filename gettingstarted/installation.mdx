      <Step title = "Authorize">

        After installation, you will be prompted by Visual Studio Code on the bottom right to authorize Codeium. If not, you will need to sign in to your Codeium account in the bottom left Accounts tab of your Visual Studio Code window.
        
        <Tip>If you get an error message indicating that the browser cannot open a link from Visual Studio Code, you may need to update your browser and restart the authorization flow.</Tip>

      </Step>
      <Step title = "Sign In">

        If you are not signed in, please sign in with your account details. Once you sign in, you will be redirected back to Visual Studio Code via pop-up.
        
        _If you are using a browser-based IDE, you will be routed to instructions on how to complete authentication by providing an access token._

      </Step>
      <Step title = "Wait for language server">

        Once you are all signed in, Codeium will start downloading the language server. This is the program that actually communicates with our APIs to let you use Codeium. Depending on your internet connection, this download may take a few minutes.
        
        You should see a notification on the bottom right to indicate the progress of the download.
