Just how our Autocomplete passively predicts text, **Codeium Supercomplete** passively predicts your next intent. 

You can see Supercomplete in action below, which shows the suggested diff within a box next to your code, directly in the editor. Just press `tab` to accept the suggestion!

Supercomplete makes suggestions based on the context of your code, _both before and after_ your current cursor position..

Suggestions appear in a box on the side as you type. You can press `esc` to cancel a suggestion.

## Use cases to trigger Supercomplete

Supercomplete and Autocomplete work in harmony to provide you with the smoothest experience to optimize your flow state. 

That being said, Supercomplete will only trigger in certain scenarios where it is most beneficial to the developer. Below, you can find a few examples of helpful Supercomplete use cases.
