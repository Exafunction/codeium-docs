Command enables streamlined experiences for a few common operations.

## Function Refactors and Docstring Generation

Above functions and classes, Codeium renders _code lenses_,
which are small, clickable text labels that invoke Codeium's AI capabilities on the labeled item.

<Tip>You can disable code lenses by clicking the `✕` to the right of the code lens text.</Tip>

The `Refactor` and `Docstring` code lenses in particular will invoke Command.
- If you click `Refactor`, Codeium will prompt you with a dropdown of selectable, pre-populated
instructions that you can choose from. You can also write your own. This is equivalent to highlighting the function and invoking Command.
- If you click `Docstring`, Codeium will generate a docstring for you above the function header.
(In Python, the docstring will be correctly generated _underneath_ the function header.)

## Smart Paste

This feature allows you to copy code and paste it into a file in your IDE written in a different programming language.
Use `⌘+⌥+V` (Mac) or `Ctrl+Alt+V` (Windows/Linux) to invoke Smart Paste.
Behind the scenes, Codeium will detect the language of the destination file and use Command to translate the code in your clipboard.
Codeium's context awareness will try to write it to fit in your code, for example by referencing proper variable names.

Some possible use cases:
- **Migrating code**: you're rewriting JavaScript into TypeScript, or Java into Kotlin.
- **Pasting from Stack Overflow**: you found a utility function online written in Go, but you're using Rust.
- **Learning a new language**: you're curious about Haskell and want to see what your would look like if written in it.
