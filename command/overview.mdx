Codeium Command allows you to generate new or edit existing code via natural language inputs _directly in the editor window._ 

To invoke Command, hit `Ctrl`/`Cmd` + `I`. From there, you can enter a prompt in natural language and Codeium will provide a multiline suggestion that you can accept or reject. 

You can also use Command to edit existing functions as shown below. Simply highlight the code you wish to edit and press `Ctrl`/`Cmd` + `I`.

# Best Practices

- Command is great for command based, in-line changes.

    - This model is trained to be especially good at instruction following.

    - Compared to Autocomplete, this model is slightly larger.

    - Highlight the block of code before invoking Command to edit the selection.
