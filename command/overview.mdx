Codeium Command allows you to generate new or edit existing code via natural language inputs _directly in the editor window._ 

To invoke Command, hit `Ctrl`/`Cmd` + `I`. From there, you can enter a prompt in natural language and Codeium will provide a multiline suggestion that you can accept or reject. 

You can also use Command to edit existing functions as shown below. Simply highlight the code you wish to edit and press `Ctrl`/`Cmd` + `I`.

# Best Practices

Command is great for file-scoped, in-line changes that you can describe as an instruction in natural language.
Here are some pointers to keep in mind:

    - The model that powers Command is larger than the one powering autocomplete.
    It is slower but more capable, and it is trained to be especially good at instruction-following.

    - If you highlight a block of code before invoking Command, it will edit the selection. Otherwise, it will do a pure generation.
