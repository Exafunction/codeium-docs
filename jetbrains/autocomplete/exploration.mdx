**Autocomplete** is Codeium's base in-editor functionality,
useful for quickly finishing a line of code and short snippets thereafter.
Codeium will automatically display code suggestions based on the code you've written so far,
taking into consideration the current cursor position as well as surrounding code context.

The AI will compute suggestions on every keystroke,
but will only display one if it believes it's likely to be useful or relevant.
Hit tab (`â‡¥`) to accept a suggestion, and `esc` to cancel it.
