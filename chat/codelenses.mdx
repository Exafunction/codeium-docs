Above each function and class definition, you will find what we call Code Lenses.

These allow you to easily Refactor, Explain, and Generate Docstrings directly in the editor in conjunction with Codeium Chat. 


## Refactor

When you click the `Refactor` button in the Code Lens, you will be prompted to add natural language instructions to nudge Codeium towards exactly how you would like to refactor your code. 

For example, you can ask Codeium to convert your code from one language to another.

You can also utilize the `Refactor` Code Lens to implement new code for your `#TODO` comments!

## Explain

Click on the `Explain` button in the Code Lens to prompt Codeium to generate a summary directly in Chat. 

## Problem Explain

If you encounter an error in your editor, Codeium is there to help! Simply hover over the incorrect code underlined in red, and click `Codeium: Explain Problem` to enlist Codeium's help directly in the Chat.
