While we provide and train our own dedicated models for Chat, we also give you the flexibility choose your favorites.

It's worth noting that the Codeium models are tightly integrated with our reasoning stack, leading to better quality suggestions than external models for coding-specific tasks. 

Due to our industry-leading infrastructure, we are able to offer them for free (or at very low cost) to our users.
