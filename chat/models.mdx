While we provide and train our own dedicated models for Chat, we also give you the flexibility choose your favorites.

It's worth noting that the Codeium models are tightly integrated with our reasoning stack, leading to better quality suggestions than external models for coding-specific tasks. 

Due to our industry leading infrastructure, we are able to offer them for free (or at very low cost) to our users.  


## Base Model ⚡

**Access:** All users

Available for unlimited use to all users is a fast, high quality Llama 3.1-70B based Codeium Chat model.

This model is optimized for speed, and is the **_fastest_** model available in Codeium Chat. This is all while still being extremely accurate.



## Codeium Premier 🚀


**Access:** Any paying users (Teams, Enterprise, etc)

Available in our paid tier is unlimited usage of our Premier, Llama 3.1-405B based Codeium Chat model. 

This is the **_best_** performing model available for use in Codeium, due to its size and native integration with Codeium's reasoning engine and native workflows. 

## Other Models (GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet)

**Access:** Any paying users (Teams, Enterprise, etc)

Codeium provides access to OpenAI's and Anthropic's flagship models, available for use in any of our paid tiers. 

These models will be subject to slower speeds and latency delays, due to the fact that they are unable to be optimized to Codeium's reasoning engine and native workflows.
