When talking with Codeium Chat, you can easily refererence various parts of your code by using @ Mentions. Simply type `@` to get started!

## Chat with Code

Directly mention functions and classes in your code to understand the runtime of functions, check for styling issues, and much much more.

Certain functions or classes may take a while for us to read through so let’s ask a question about it and have Codeium Chat parse through it instead.

You can also choose pin your @ Mention by clicking on it.

## Chat with Libraries

Refer to a set of popular repositories and libraries to get more accurate and up-to-date answers by telling Codeium Chat to auto-grab relevant context directly from the library’s code.

There are a variety of libraries we support, just @ Mention the library and prompt Codeium Chat accordingly!

## Chat with Terminal 

Explore your in-IDE terminal output to parse through large logs, understand complex results, and debug failed tests.

Open up the in-IDE terminal and run any command, then use `@terminal` to ask a question about it.

## Chat with Git Diffs

You can also chat with your locally made, uncommited changes using `@diff`! This is essentially chatting with all of the changes made in your `git diff`.
