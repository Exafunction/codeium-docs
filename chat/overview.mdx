Chat is powered by our industry leading [Context Awareness](/contextawareness/overview.mdx) engine is the secret sauce that makes Codeium great. By grabbing snippets from relevant parts of your codebase, our language models are then able to provide more accurate, grounded answers.


## @ Mentions 

Easily add custom context in your Chat prompt just by using @ Mentions to reference your functions, classes, files, directories, and repositories.

For more information, please see our [@ Mentions](/chat/atmentions) page.

To persist certain context, you can also check out our [Context Pinning](/contextawareness/contextpinning) page.

## Slash Commands

Text-based triggers for common workflows, building on top of Code Lenses and right click dropdown on highlight. We are starting with simply typing `/explain` in the Chat input, but [let us know](https://codeium.canny.io/feature-requests/) what other common workflows you want wrapped in a slash command.

## Copy and Insert

Easily `Copy` to clipboard and/or `Insert` snippets of suggested code directly from the Chat.

## Inline Citations

In an effort to provide insight into Chat's responses, our reasoning engine will pull in the most relevant context it used from your codebase.

## Code Lenses

Code lenses will appear right above functions and class definitions and offer shortcuts to `Explain` and `Refactor` code, or to `Generate Docstrings`. Clicking on these shortcuts will invoke Codeium Chat with the relevant prompt and context.

Read more about Code Lenses in the Chat [Tips](/chat/codelenses).

## Regenerate with Context

By default, Codeium makes a judgment call whether a question is general or if it requires codebase context. 

If you want to force the use of codebase context, you can quickly rerun with context with a single button.

## Chat Insights

Lots of work is clearly going on under the hood for every Chat message, and now you can click the stats icon to see these statistics for yourself. Was context used? How long did the various stages take? How many context items were considered?
