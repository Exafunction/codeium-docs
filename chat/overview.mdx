<Note>
Chat and its related features are only supported in: VS Code, JetBrains IDEs, Eclipse, X-Code, and Visual Studio.
</Note>

Codeium Chat enables you to talk to your codebase from within your editor. 
Chat is powered by our industry-leading [context awareness](/context-awareness/overview.mdx) engine.
It combines thoughtfully-designed, built-in context retrieval with optional user guidance to provide accurate and grounded answers.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="VS Code">
    In VS Code, Codeium Chat can be found by default on the left sidebar.
    If you wish to move it elsewhere, you can click and drag the Codeium icon and relocate it as desired.

    You can use `⌘+⇧+A` on Mac or `Ctrl+⇧+A` on Windows/Linux to open the chat panel and toggle focus between it and the editor.
    You can also pop the chat window out of the IDE entirely by clicking the page icon at the top of the chat panel.

  <Tab title="JetBrains">
    In JetBrains IDEs, Codeium Chat can be found by default on the right sidebar.

    You can use `⌘+⇧+L` on Mac or `Ctrl+⇧+L` on Windows/Linux to open the chat panel while you are typing in the editor.
    You can also open the chat in a popped-out browser window by clicking `Tools > Codeium > Open Codeium Chat in Browser` in the top menu bar.
  </Tab>

## @ Mentions 

In any given chat message you send, you can explicitly refer to context items from within the chat input by prefixing a word with `@`.
Context items can be functions, classes, directories and files in your codebase, remote repositories, or (in VS Code only) the contents of your terminal.

## Persistent Context

You can instruct the chat model to use certain context throughout a conversation and across different converstions
by configuring the `Context` tab in the chat panel.

</Frame>

In this tab, you can see:
- **Custom Chat Instructions**: a short prompt guideline like "Respond in Kotlin and assume I have little familiarity with it" to orient the model towards a certain type of response.
- **Pinned Contexts**: items from your codebase like files, directories, and code snippets that you would like explicitly for the model to take into account.
- **Active Document**: a marker for your currently active file, which receives special focus.
- **Local Indexes**: a list of local repositories that the Codeium context engine has indexed.

## Slash Commands

You can prefix a message with `/explain` to ask the model to explain something of your choice.
Currently, `/explain` is the only supported slash command.
[Let us know](https://codeium.canny.io/feature-requests/) if there are other common workflows you want wrapped in a slash command.

## Copy and Insert

Easily `Copy` to clipboard and/or `Insert` snippets of suggested code directly from the Chat.

## Inline Citations

Chat is aware of code context items, and its responses often contain linked references to snippets of code in your files.

## Regenerate with Context

By default, Codeium makes a judgment call whether any given question is general or if it requires codebase context. 

You can force the model to use codebase context by submitting your question with `⌘⏎`.
For a question that has already received a response, you rerun with context by clicking the sparkle icon.

## Stats for Nerds

Lots of things happen under the hood for every chat message. You can click the stats icon to see these statistics for yourself.

## Chat History 

To revisit past conversations, click the history icon at the top of the chat panel. 
You can click the `+` to create a new conversation, and
you can click the `⋮` button to export your conversation.

## Settings

Click on the `Settings` tab to update your theme preferences (light or dark) and font size. 
The settings panel also gives you an option to download diagnostics, which are debug logs that can be helpful
for the Codeium team to debug an issue should you encounter one.
