When talking with Codeium Chat, you can easily refererence various parts of your code by using @ Mentions. Simply type `@` to get started.

## \@Code

Directly mention functions and classes in your code to understand the runtime of functions, check for styling issues, and much much more.

Certain functions or classes may take a while for us to read through so let’s ask a question about it and have Codeium Chat parse through it instead.

You can also choose pin your @ Mention by clicking on it in the Chat.

## \@Repository

Refer to a set of popular repositories and libraries to get more accurate and up-to-date answers by telling Codeium Chat to auto-grab relevant context directly from the library’s code.

There are a variety of libraries we support, just @ Mention the library and prompt Codeium Chat accordingly!

## \@Terminal 

Explore your in-IDE terminal output to parse through large logs, understand complex results, and debug failed tests.

Open up the in-IDE terminal and run any command, then use `@terminal` to ask a question about it.

## Chat with Git Diffs

You can also chat with your locally made, uncommited changes using `@diff`! This is essentially chatting with all of the changes made in your `git diff`.
