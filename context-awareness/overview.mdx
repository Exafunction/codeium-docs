Codeium's proprietary context engine builds a deep understanding of your codebase by using multiple heuristics to figure out the most relevant code snippets for each request, leading higher quality suggestions and less hallucinations. 

Historically, you had to specifically "fine tune" the model but with Codeium, this is no longer necessary. 

<Note>Codeium does offer full fine-tuning for enterprise, and the best solution combines the two features together. However, the Context Module is highly effective at personalization on its own.</Note>

## Default Context

Out of the box, Codeium takes multiple relevant sources of context into consideration. 

- The current file and other open files in your IDE as these are often highly relevant to the code being written. 

- The entire local codebase is then indexed (even the files that are not open), and relevant code snippets are pulled in by Codeium's retrieval engine as you make queries or write code.

- For Teams and Enterprise users, Codeium can also index remote repositories. This is useful for companies where the development organization works across multiple repositories.

## Context Pinning

You can also customize the context engine by pinning any scope of code (repository, directory, file, function, etc). These take priority in the context engine for any future suggestions.
