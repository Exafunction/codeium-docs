Our autocomplete makes in-line and multi-line suggestions based on the context of your code.

Suggestions appear in grey text as you type. You can press `esc` to cancel a suggestion.
Suggestions will also disappear if you continue typing or navigating without accepting them.

## Keyboard Shortcuts
Here are shortcuts that apply for MacOS.
Replace `⌘` with `Ctrl` and `⌥` with `Alt` to get the corresponding shortcuts on Windows/Linux.
