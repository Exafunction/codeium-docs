## Inline Comments

You can instruct autocomplete with the use of comments in your code. Codeium will read these comments and suggest the code to bring the comment to life. Boilerplate code has never been easier!

Codeium is the only autocomplete tool that can Fill In The Middle (FIM). It takes in context from before and after the cursor in order to make both in-line and multi-line suggestions.
