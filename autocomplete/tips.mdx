## Inline Comments

You can instruct autocomplete with the use of comments in your code. Codeium will read these comments and suggest the code to bring the comment to life. Boilerplate code has never been easier!

## Fill In The Middle (FIM)

Codeium's Autocomplete can Fill In The Middle (FIM). It takes in context from before and after the cursor in order to make both in-line and multi-line suggestions.

We also have the only Autocomplete on the market that can do In-line FIM. This means the autocomplete suggestions can take in context from before and after the cursor's position, within the same line.
