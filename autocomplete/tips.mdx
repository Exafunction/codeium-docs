## Inline Comments

You can instruct autocomplete with the use of comments in your code.
Codeium will read these comments and suggest the code to bring the comment to life.

This method can get you good mileage, but if you're finding value in writing natural-language instructions and having the AI execute them,
consider using [Codeium Command](/command/overview).
